- TODO
  - Get rid of this doc
  - Add one set of ### to the headings.

##### COMMAND LANGUAGE
####
###

And then comments are like this

## This is an idea.

## Format of this file
## 
## Lines that begin with two or more # signs are special.
##
## 2: comment that is omitted
## 3, 4, 5: three levels of sections.
##
## These are turned into <h2> <h3> <h4> tags in HTML, with <a> anchors.
## In help text.


Idea:

This is a short, dense, and slightly opinionated overview of OSH, a
bash-compatible shell.

(I don't want to write huge amounts of docs for OSH.  More for Oil.)

Maybe there will never be a proper manual?

- Flat namespace:  #let  #pipe  etc.
- SINGLE FILE.  Must be short enough for a single file.


osh_quick_ref.py -> 

- Turn into HTML with hyperlinks.  I think it's not even Markdown or what?

  http://oilshell.org/doc/v0.0.0/osh-quick-ref.html

- Turn into text for including in the binary
  _build/help/
    osh-usage.txt  : This is also osh --help, and man page.
    toc.txt
    pipe.txt
    simple-command.txt

    So you have random access?

- Turn the [osh-usage] into a man page.  Just refer to in-shell help and online
  manual in the man page.


I do like serif/san-serif for readaibilty

Syntax highlighting for code.  Do I need full markdown?

Bottom line:
- I'm saving writing the Online manual, in-shell help, and man page.  I'm
  writing a single text file that serves as all.

NOTE: Also do this for oil, wok, etc.


Other generated things:
  index of all #tags
  builtins in alphabetical order?

Idea: Examples from SPEC TESTS.  Hm.
  
You could have a file#label spec test or something.
